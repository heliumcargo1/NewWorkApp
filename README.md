## Inspiration & Motivation

Most of the employees in our company work remote at home (100% remote work possible), some employees prefer to work 100% in office and they have their own desks. The rest of the offices are shared desk spaces with different kind of hardware on it. Monitore, Dockingstations and so on. And not every employees Notebook is compatible with every hardware on the desk.
In this application it should be easy to see on an office floor plan which desks are compatible with my hardware (user login reqired). 
The matching of hardware on the desks and available hardware of the empleyees are administrated at the Admin-Area (roles and permission system needed).

It should be possible to create several office locations (london, berlin, vienna), and on this locations several offices with the floor plan and desks (Visual Floor Plan like an Fire Emergency Plan).
The compatible Desks should be marked as green, some incompatible components marked in orange and full uncompatible desks or desks not available to use marked in red.
With an hover over the Desks a list of Hardware on this Desk should be shown to double check if desired.

All components should be changeable dynamically - in case the the company adds a new hardware or exit old ones.
